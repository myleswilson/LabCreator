Makes creating files for C++ labs easier.

WHEN RUNNING FOR THE FIRST TIME, YOU MUST OPEN THE SCRIPT AND ENTER YOUR COURSE NAME!

When the program first runs after being configured it creates:
* The course folder.
* A bash compiling script.
* A vim .cpp file named after the lab (and opens it for the user).
